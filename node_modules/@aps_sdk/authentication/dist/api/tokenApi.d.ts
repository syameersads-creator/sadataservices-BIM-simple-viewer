     * Returns a browser URL to redirect an end user in order to acquire the user’s consent to authorize the application to access resources on their behalf.  Invoking this operation is the first step in authenticating users and retrieving an authorization code grant. The authorization code that is generated remains valid for 5 minutes, while the ID token stays valid for 60 minutes. Any access tokens you obtain are valid for 60 minutes, and refresh tokens remain valid for 15 days.  This operation has a rate limit of 500 calls per minute.  **Note:** This operation is intended for use with client-side applications only. It is not suitable for server-side applications.
     * @summary Authorize User
     * @param {string} clientId The Client ID of the calling application, as registered with APS.
     * @param {ResponseType} responseType The type of response you want to receive. Possible values are:   -  &#x60;&#x60;code&#x60;&#x60; - Authorization code grant. -  &#x60;&#x60;id_token&#x60;&#x60; - OpenID Connect ID token.
     * @param {string} redirectUri The URI that APS redirects users to after they grant or deny access permission to the application. Must match the Callback URL for the application as registered with APS.  Must be specified as a URL-safe string. It can include query parameters or any other valid URL construct.
     * @param {string} [nonce] A random string that is sent with the request. APS passes back the same string to you so that you can verify whether you received the same string that you sent. This check mitigates token replay attacks
     * @param {string} [state] A URL-encoded random string. The authorization flow will pass the same string back to the Callback URL using the &#x60;&#x60;state&#x60;&#x60; query string parameter. This process helps ensure that the callback you receive is a response to what you originally requested. It prevents malicious actors from forging requests.  The string can only contain alphanumeric characters, commas, periods, underscores, and hyphens.
     * @param {Scopes} [scopes] A URL-encoded space-delimited list of requested scopes. See the &#x60;Developer\&#39;s Guide documentation on scopes &lt;/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/scopes/&gt;&#x60;_ for a list of valid values you can provide.  The string you specify for this parameter must not exceed 2000 characters and it cannot contain more than 50 scopes.
     * @param {string} [responseMode] Specifies how the authorization response should be returned. Valid values are:  - &#x60;&#x60;fragment&#x60;&#x60; - Encode the response parameters in the fragment of the redirect URI. A fragment in a URI is the optional part of the URI that appears after a &#x60;&#x60;#&#x60;&#x60; symbol, which refers to a specific section within a resource. For example, &#x60;&#x60;section&#x60;&#x60; in &#x60;&#x60;https://www.mysite.org/myresource#section&#x60;&#x60;. - &#x60;&#x60;form_post&#x60;&#x60; - Embed the authorization response parameter in an HTML form. - &#x60;&#x60;query&#x60;&#x60; -  Embed the authorization response as a query string parameter of the redirect URI.

     * @param {string} [prompt] Specifies how to prompt users for authentication. Possible values are:   - &#x60;&#x60;login&#x60;&#x60; : Always prompt the user for authentication, regardless of the state of the login session.   **Note:** If you do not specify this parameter, the system will not prompt the user for authentication as long as a login session is active. If a login session is not active, the system will prompt the user for authentication.
     * @param {string} [authoptions] A JSON object containing options that specify how to display the sign-in page. Refer the &#x60;Developer\&#39;s Guide documentation on AuthOptions &lt;/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/authoptions/&gt;&#x60;_ for supported values.
     * @param {string} [codeChallenge] A URL-encoded string derived from the code verifier sent in the authorization request with the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant flow.
     * @param {string} [codeChallengeMethod] The method used to derive the code challenge for the PKCE grant flow. Possible value is:  - &#x60;&#x60;S256&#x60;&#x60;- Hashes the code verifier using the SHA-256 algorithm and then applies Base64 URL encoding.

     * @param {string} redirectUri The URI that APS redirects users to after they grant or deny access permission to the application. Must match the Callback URL for the application as registered with APS.  Must be specified as a URL-safe string. It can include query parameters or any other valid URL construct.
     * @param {string} [nonce] A random string that is sent with the request. APS passes back the same string to you so that you can verify whether you received the same string that you sent. This check mitigates token replay attacks
     * @param {string} [state] A URL-encoded random string. The authorization flow will pass the same string back to the Callback URL using the &#x60;&#x60;state&#x60;&#x60; query string parameter. This process helps ensure that the callback you receive is a response to what you originally requested. It prevents malicious actors from forging requests.  The string can only contain alphanumeric characters, commas, periods, underscores, and hyphens.
     * @param {Scopes} [scope] A URL-encoded space-delimited list of requested scopes. See the &#x60;Developer\&#39;s Guide documentation on scopes &lt;/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/scopes/&gt;&#x60;_ for a list of valid values you can provide.  The string you specify for this parameter must not exceed 2000 characters and it cannot contain more than 50 scopes.
     * @param {string} [responseMode] Specifies how the authorization response should be returned. Valid values are:  - &#x60;&#x60;fragment&#x60;&#x60; - Encode the response parameters in the fragment of the redirect URI. A fragment in a URI is the optional part of the URI that appears after a &#x60;&#x60;#&#x60;&#x60; symbol, which refers to a specific section within a resource. For example, &#x60;&#x60;section&#x60;&#x60; in &#x60;&#x60;https://www.mysite.org/myresource#section&#x60;&#x60;. - &#x60;&#x60;form_post&#x60;&#x60; - Embed the authorization response parameter in an HTML form. - &#x60;&#x60;query&#x60;&#x60; -  Embed the authorization response as a query string parameter of the redirect URI.   If &#x60;&#x60;id_token&#x60;&#x60; is stated as &#x60;&#x60;response_type&#x60;&#x60;,  only &#x60;&#x60;form_post&#x60;&#x60; is allowed as &#x60;&#x60;response_mode&#x60;&#x60;.\&#39;
     * @param {string} [prompt] Specifies how to prompt users for authentication. Possible values are:   - &#x60;&#x60;login&#x60;&#x60; : Always prompt the user for authentication, regardless of the state of the login session.   **Note:** If you do not specify this parameter, the system will not prompt the user for authentication as long as a login session is active. If a login session is not active, the system will prompt the user for authentication.
     * @param {string} [authoptions] A JSON object containing options that specify how to display the sign-in page. Refer the &#x60;Developer\&#39;s Guide documentation on AuthOptions &lt;/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/authoptions/&gt;&#x60;_ for supported values.
     * @param {string} [codeChallenge] A URL-encoded string derived from the code verifier sent in the authorization request with the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) grant flow.
     * @param {string} [codeChallengeMethod] The method used to derive the code challenge for the PKCE grant flow. Possible value is:  - &#x60;&#x60;S256&#x60;&#x60;- Hashes the code verifier using the SHA-256 algorithm and then applies Base64 URL encoding.
